# featuretools
This project includes an update to featuretools and all accompanying packages. As of now, this will run on Windows and I am confirming that it works for Mac.

Adapted exercise from here: https://github.com/Featuretools/predict-customer-churn/blob/master/churn/3.%20Feature%20Engineering.ipynb

Here is a video showing how to run the tutorial in colab or in a python env on your machine.
