## 1. Business Problem
A new e-commerce site in the U.S. wants highly accurate model to classify images of traditional Indian clothing since many of these clothes are quite similar.

## 2. Data
The model was trained on data from the Indo Fashion dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/validmodel/indo-fashion-dataset). This dataset has 91166 training images, 7500 validation images, 7500 test images, and 15 different labels: 

Women’s Kurtas. Sarees, Blouses, Leggings and Salwars, Men’s Kurtas, Dupattas, Nehru jackets, Lehenga, Gowns, Petticoats, Dhoti Pants, Palazzos, Women’s Mojaris, Sherwanis, Men’s Mojaris

New test images were scraped using Beautiful Soup from the following sites:

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Plots of the sizes of images in the training set and each test set are shown below. The images varied greatly in size; however, the new test set's average image size is larger than the training set or the original test set. One image is not plotted in the new test set because it is very large.
